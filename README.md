# STI-UserDeveloperTest
date:    2017/04/21
version: 1.0.0

## UI Developer Test
As part of STI's screening process, applicants are requested to complete a test that will help confirm their ability to perform the requirements for the position. This is my test submission.

## Installing Dependencies
This project uses gulp to compile and minify SCSS files into CSS files. To install gulp you must have node.js installed. You can install the current node.js release from https://nodejs.org if you don't have it.
Open a terminal and navigate to this directory, then type "npm install" and press Enter.
Wait for all of the dependencies to finish downloading.

## Running the Test
In the same terminal that you used to install the dependencies, type "gulp" and press Enter.
Open "index.html" in your preferred browser.
When finished, close the browser tab and the terminal with gulp running.

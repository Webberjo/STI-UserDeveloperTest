## UI Developer Test
As part of STI's screening process, applicants are requested to complete a test that will help confirm their ability to perform the requirements for the position. This is my test submission.

## Installing Dependencies
**You do not need to install dependencies unless you plan on making changes to the styles.**  
This project uses gulp to compile and minify SCSS files into CSS files. To install gulp you must first have node.js installed. You can install the current node.js release from https://nodejs.org if you don't have it.  
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory you cloned this repository to, then type "npm install" and press Enter.  
Wait for all of the dependencies to finish downloading.  
Type "gulp" and press Enter.

## Running the Test
Open "index.html" in your preferred browser.
